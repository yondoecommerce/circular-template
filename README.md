Circular Template
================
This is a copy of the *circular [Yondo](http://www.yondo.com) Template*. It can be used as a sample for your own template development.

## What is Yondo? ##
Yondo is a web based platform providing video e-commerce services for companies and organizations. It provides online video subscriptions, pay-per-view rentals & live video sessions. 

## What is an Yondo Template? ##
Included with an Yondo account is a *hosted store website*. This provides a front-end for your customers to use when browsing your live session listings, and video-on-demand products. A highly customizable template engine provides the web content for this front-end. Every Yondo *store* uses either a standard template, or a custom installed template. **A template is basically a collection of html, css and other standard files you would find on a website.**

## How do I develop a Template? ##
Go to the [Yondo Partner Network](http://partners.yondo.com/signup) and sign up for a developer account. Here you can create and upload your template, and create a development store to test your template. The editing functions are quite basic, most developers create their template externally and just upload when done.
